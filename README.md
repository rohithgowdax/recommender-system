# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A content-based movie recommendation system built using **cosine similarity**. It suggests movies similar to the selected one and fetches their **posters** using the **TMDb API**. The app is hosted using **Streamlit**.

## 📌 Features

- Recommends 5 similar movies using **cosine similarity**
- Fetches **movie posters** using **TMDb API**
- Clean UI with **Streamlit** interface
- Includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and preprocessing
- Easy to use – select a movie and get instant recommendations

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing & EDA**:
   - Handled missing values
   - Merged relevant metadata (genres, cast, crew, etc.)
   - Created a "tags" feature by combining relevant text fields

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Applied **Bag-of-Words** 
   - Calculated **cosine similarity** matrix between movies

3. **TMDb API Integration**:
   - Used API to fetch poster images by movie ID

4. **Streamlit App**:
   - Dropdown to select movie
   - Display recommendations with poster thumbnails

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was performed to:
  - Understand data distribution
  - Identify and handle missing data
  - Analyze popular genres, actors, keywords, etc.
  - Improve feature engineering for better recommendations
  - Find the full EDA in eda.ipynb.
